## Background:
  
  + A plant is subject to a wide range of environmental stresses that can limit the growth and development of the plant. In this research, the study of distribution and diversity of the bacterial gene **_1-aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylate deaminase (ACCd)_** is examined. **_ACCd_** is an enzyme that promotes plant growth and development during stress by decreasing plant ethylene levels, especially following a variety of environmental stresses. Enviornmental stress consist of both bitoic and abiotic stress. Bitoic stress consist fungal and bacterial pathogens, plant viruses, insect predation, nematode infections. Abiotic stress consist of temperature (High and Low), drought, flooding, high salt concentrations (sea blast), organic/ non-organic contaminants and excessive radiation. The plant is influenced by theses stressors to synthesize growth-inhibiting stress ethylene. As a result of these factors stress ethylene, formally known as ethylene synthesis is produced thus inducing decreased root and shoot lengths, increase leaf abscission, decreased dry weight, decreased chlorophyll content and decreased protein synthesis.
  + There is a gray area called Dark Matter, this consist of Diversity, Abundance, Phylogeny and Structure. However, this research will examine this area of Dark Matter in order to produce results, which can be beneficial to the world's population by increase food security. The distribution of **_ACCd_** is examined by retrieving its metadata, which includes _Gene ID, Locus Tag, Genome ID, Environmental data (geographical location, GPS cords), Culture Type, Depth, Ecosystem Category, Ecosystem Subtype, Ecosystem Type, Habitat, Isolation Country, Study Name and Sequencing Method._ The genome sequencing is crucial for a phylogenic tree which depicts a diagrammatic hypothesis of the history of the evolutionary relationship of this this gene.
  
  
## Commands:

### Gene Search:

* To search for ACC deaminase gene from JGI IMG, go to (https://img.jgi.doe.gov/cgi-bin/m/main.cgi?section=FindGenes&page=findGenes). Then set the Keyword to **1-aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylate deaminase**, set the **Filters** to Gene Product Name (inexact). 
  
* In regards to the **Sequencing Staus** click on All Finished, Permanent Draft and Draft. On the right of **Sequencing Status** you will see **Domain**, there are option such as Archaea, Bacteria, Eukaryota, Metagenome, All (Slow) and Gene Cart.
  
  **_Note_**: _You can search the three Kingdoms of Life (Archaea, Bacteria, Eukaryote), but the **_acdS_** gene is most prevelant in the Metagenome category_.
  
* Be sure that the **List** is highlighted, then click **Show**.
  
* A large list of studies will appear where the gene may or may not exist, select at most 50 at a time and add to **Selected Genomes**.
  
* After these steps are executed, click **Go**.
  
  
### Gene list and Gene Cart

* Now, the Gene ID, Locus Tag, Gene Product Name and Genomes will be displayed. There is an option called **All** to select all pages.
    
* Then click _Export_, this will now export an excel file named **genelist**. Now click on **Add Selected to Gene Cart**, scroll lower until the Table Configuration is visible in which the Gene Field, Scaffold/ Contig Field, Function Field and Project Metadata can all be selected with the option all. Then click **Display Genes Again**, thus the metadate can now be retrieved by clicking **Export**.
    
### Export Genes 

* After the metadata has been exported, there will be an option called **Upload & Export**, in the **Export Genes** click the *FASTA Nucleic Acid* format. Click **Show in Export Format** and the sequences will be exported in a .txt format.
