### Gene Search:

  To search for ACC deaminase gene from JGI IMG, go to ([Find Genes] (https://img.jgi.doe.gov/cgi-bin/m/main.cgi?section=FindGenes&page=findGenes)). Then set the Keyword to **1-aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylate deaminase**, set the **Filters** to Gene Product Name (inexact). 
  
  In regards to the **Sequencing Staus** click on All Finished, Permanent Draft and Draft. On the right of **Sequencing Status** you will see **Domain**, there are option such as Archeae, Bacteria, Eukaryota, Metagenome, All (Slow) and Gene Cart.
  
  **_Note_**: _You can search the three Kingdoms of Life (Archeae, Bacteria, Eukaryote), but the **_acdS_** gene is most prevelant in the Metagenome category_.
  
  Be sure that the **List** is highlighted, then click **Show**.
  
  A large list of studies will appear where the gene may or may not exist, select at most 50 at a time and add to **Selected Genomes**.
  
  After these steps are executed, click **Go**.
  
  
### Gene list and Gene Cart

  Now, the Gene ID, Locus Tag, Gene Product Name and Genomes will be displayed. There is an option called **All** to select all pages.
    
   Then click _Export_, this will now export an excel file named **genelist**. Now click on **Add Selected to Gene Cart**, scroll lower until the Table Configuration is visible in which the Gene Field, Scaffold/ Contig Field, Function Field and Project Metadata can all be selected with the option all. Then click **Display Genes Again**, thus the metadate can now be retrieved by clicking **Export**.
    
### Export Genes 

  After the metadata has been exported, there will be an option called **Upload & Export**, in the **Export Genes** click the *FASTA Nucleic Acid format*. Click **Show in Export Format** and the sequences will be exported in a .txt format.
