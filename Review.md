**To Identify and Investigate the Distribution of ACCd in the Environment**

Objective:
  1. Explore the expected distribution of ACCd in the environment from JGI IMG (The Integrated Microbial Genomes)
  2. Aggregate metadata (Gene ID, Genome Name, Location, Locus Tag) 
  3. Aggregate sequences of uncultured genes
  4. Use alignment algorithms such as QIIME and MUSCLE (multiple sequence alignment) 
  5. Create a phylogeny of cultured and uncultured and examine the distribution of ACCd
